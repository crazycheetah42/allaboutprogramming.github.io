<h1>A note about programming</h1>
<p>
    This note is especially for those who expect things to happen first time: You have to be patient, because there might be a mistake, or <b>bug</b>, that you have to fix. It's <b><u>PERFECTLY</u></b> okay if things don't work out the first few tries. Just improve your code, and the webpage too will improve!
